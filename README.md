# 📊 Stock Analysis Project -Internship Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market data to identify trends, visualize patterns, and provide insights for better decision-making. Using Python’s data science libraries, the project extracts meaningful metrics such as moving averages, daily returns, and cumulative returns. It also visualizes stock price movements and compares multiple stocks to highlight performance differences over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and calculations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – Development environment  

## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
StockAnalysis/
│-- modeltraing/ # Jupyter notebooks for analysis
│-- csv files containg the model and the evaluation metrices
│-- forecast_dashboard.py #the streamlit app

```


## 📑 Key Features
- Import and clean stock market datasets  
- Calculate **daily returns**, **moving averages**, and **cumulative returns**  
- Compare stock performance across multiple companies

📈 Insights

## 📈 Insights
This project provides a strong foundation for **financial time-series analysis** by identifying trends, volatility, and seasonal patterns in stock prices. Beyond basic analysis, advanced forecasting models such as **ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM** are implemented to capture both short-term and long-term trends. Seasonality, cyclic behavior, and market irregularities are also analyzed to improve forecasting accuracy. The project can be further extended by integrating **live stock APIs**, developing **real-time dashboards**, and building **predictive trading strategies**.
